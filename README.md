# Java-student-s-project
This project was created as a part of a student's project in the field of object-oriented programming. The project consists of three applications: 
1. Stack,
2. Sort and 
3. Drawing. 
## Stack
The idea of Stack is to imitate the functionality of stack, implementing the LIFO method to objects of class Rectangle. 
## Sort
The Sort application is used to sort the added rectangles in an ascending order by area. 
## Drawing
The third application, and a more complex one, represents my version of Paint application, having some similar options, including drawing, modifying, selection, deleting and etc.
